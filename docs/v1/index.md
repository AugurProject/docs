## About
[Augur v1](/v1) was the first attempt at a full-fledged decentralized Prediction Market platform for Ethereum, released in 2018. Augur v1 featured on-chain trading, a robust order-book based trading UI, and a local server component meant to be run by users to serve state for the client. Augur v1 was deprecated in 2020 with the launch of Augur v2.
