## About
[Augur v2](/v2) was released in 2020, using DAI as the trading currency and featuring Peer-to-Peer orderbooks utilizing 0x's Mesh technology. Augur v2 is still working today, with a complex trading application for users that want the order book experience. Like v1, Augur v2 also features custom market creation for users wanting to move create arbitrary market types. Developers will notice the dropping of the "Augur Node" component, as much work was done via [Augur SDK](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/packages/augur-sdk) to do all of the blockchain indexing work in the browser.
